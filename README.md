City University London Developer Assessment
===========================================

https://github.com/CityUniversityLondon/developer-assessment

In this repository you will find a simple HTML page that shows galleries of images for four of City University London’s schools.

To help us assess your knowledge and skills, we would like you to add functionality to this page.

We’re interested in how you approached each task as much as the end result, so you’re welcome to submit even if you can’t get it working, or run out of time to complete the assessment.

Stylesheets
-----------

You can either work with the generated CSS in the /css/ directory, or if you’re familiar with Sass the source is in the /sass/ directory. We don’t mind which you use.

The stylesheets are generated with [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), a Sass-based framework.

Task 1: CSS
-----------

The page is not responsive.

Add CSS to improve the appearance and usability of the page on mobile devices.

Task 2: JavaScript
------------------

The thumbnail images are direct links to the large version.

Add JavaScript so that clicking on the thumbnails displays the relevant image in a lightbox instead.

Task 3: PHP or JavaScript
-------------------------

(Optional; Required if you wish to be considered for the Web Services Developer role.)

The content is static.

There is a basic RESTful API available online, starting at http://54.225.213.167/developer-assessment/api/

Replace the static content with dynamic content generated by making calls to the API.

Deadline
--------

Please submit your solutions as a zipped folder to [webteam.jobs@city.ac.uk](mailto:webteam.jobs@city.ac.uk) by 9:00 am on Tuesday, 6th May.
